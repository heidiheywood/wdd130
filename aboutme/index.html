    <p>I am majoring in Marriage and Family studies. I am not very familiar with html and css however, I do have experience building websites. My husband and I have a web design business that we enjoy. I also love learning new things and that is a large part of why I took this class! I have been married to my husband for about a year and we currently live in Farmington, Utah. We enjoy trying new foods, watching movies, hiking and traveling. I'm excited to learn with you all this semester!</p>
