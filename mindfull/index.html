        <h1 id="hero-header">Don't Let Stress Run Your Life</h1>
        <p class="hero-message"> During my time teaching college students basic coping skills to manage the stresses of lives and I was surprised by the number of individuals that were unfamiliar with simple strategies to better handle stress.</p>
        <p class="hero-message-2">Mindfull is a website that can connect individuals with key coping strategies for the everyday stresses of life. Coping strategies are simple actions that we can do to feel more empowered with our situations by deescalating the stress we feel in our lives. They are a great first step in enabling you to interact with stress in a healthier way.</p>

            <p id="message-section-2">Stress is something we all experience in life and how we react to it can influence our perceptions of ourselves and the world around us. Sometimes we only know one way of reacting to stress because that is what we have seen or how we have always dealt with it in the past. Iâ€™m here to show options and offer another way to interact with the stress that we experience.</p>

        <p id="battery-analogy-paragraph">If we imagine our daily lives having a battery life we can see how some functions or tasks may demand more of our energy or battery power and we may need to spend some time recharging. If we leave our battery until it is at 10% it will take much longer to recharge rather than if we do a quick 15 minute recharge to get ourselves from 75% to 90%. To add onto that if we leave our recharge until the night and we don't get enough sleep we do not have enough charge in our battery to run the whole day. We will be forced to recharge at some point. It will catch up with us if we continue to try to run on 15% battery.</p>
