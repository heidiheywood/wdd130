        Mindfull is a website that will connect the average adult with key coping strategies for the everyday stresses of life. Coping strategies are simple actions that we can do to feel more empowered with our situations by deescalating the stress we feel in our lives. They are a great first step in enabling you to interact with stress in a healthier way. 
On that note, I also have personally experienced the benefits of therapy and do not qualify my webpage as a replacement for therapy. If there are weightier matters seeing a therapist may be beneficial as well. I would encourage you to still implement coping strategies into your life as they are there to help and if you think more help would be nice find a therapist that is right for you. In understanding the simplicity of coping strategies, their purpose, and their potential for positive impact I would imagine this website will provide many useful insights for the average reader. Stress is something we all experience in life and how we react to it can influence our perceptions of ourselves and the world around us. 
  Sometimes we only know one way of reacting to stress because that is what we have seen or how we have always dealt with it in the past. Iâ€™m here to show options and offer another way to interact with the stress that we experience. We sometimes know actions or behaviors that help us calm down, but we may not have identified them as coping strategies. As we better identify these coping strategies we can better intentionally and effectively utilize them in our lives. And the more we use them the easier it gets to continue to use them throughout various situations.

      <h3>Learn</h3>
      <p>
        Mindfull will have various coping strategies that are discussed. Some of them may be new and some of them may be unidentified coping strategies. There are so many different coping strategies that we will try to cover a variety of them to give each individual a plethora of options to pick from. My invitation would be to try out each one with a new perspective whether they are familiar to you or not. As you try them out you can determine which ones are most beneficial for you. Then see how you can regularly incorporate them into your life.
 These coping strategies are only beneficial to YOU if YOU use them. Be patient in your practice. New habits take time. Keeping your focus on what your goals are is key to improving your familiarity with the coping strategies that you find useful.

      <h3>Recommendations/Resources</h3>
      <p>
        There are many self-help books that I will recommend on this site that have helped me in my search for healthy relationships and healthy views of the world. I will connect affiliate links that viewers can use to buy the books or to learn more about the authors. I might also recommend some mental health apps that I have used or that I would recommend using.
